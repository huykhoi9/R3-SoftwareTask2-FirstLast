# R3-SoftwareTask2-FirstLast

In this module 2, the task is to control a rover that has 4 wheels. This task is completed by Python with 2 programs which are client.py and server.py. The client program is used to ask for the input, in this case it asks for arrow keys. In client program, I use pygame to receive the keys and the use socket to send the data to the server program. In server progam, I also use socket to connect to the client program and recieve the input. In addition, the speed of the rover can be controlled from the client by pressing the key number from 1-5.
